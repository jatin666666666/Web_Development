value and name attribute of input tag difference?

Forms - method,action
input - placeholder name type value
img br are self closing tag
meta source do not close

So while the class and id attributes are primarily used for styling and JavaScript selection, the name attribute is used for form submission and server-side processing.
value is what we give in the attribute and not what is typed after the tag as the typed value cant be passed automatically
option,select,button are tags
